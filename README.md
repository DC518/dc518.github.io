<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The group

> DCG518 is a DEF CON group focused on community, education, mentoring and bringing the Information Security Community in the New York Capital District together. Our gatherings feature presentations, workshops, Capture the Flag (CTFs), and anything else in which the community is interested. The group is community-driven, and allows its members to be active so they can learn or teach about a subject they are passionate about.
> DCG518 also supports the already-existing security-related and technology-focused groups, and we encourage members of all groups to collaborate and share knowledge. We are strong together.
> 
> The mission of the DCG518 group is to advance knowledge and educate anyone interested in science, technology, and other areas of information security through project collaborations, group gatherings, and group activities that will best serve our community and the world.
