- name: Never Break The Chain - How real attacks are built
  descr: "Have you hear of a “critical” vulnerability that should have led to a breach… but didn’t?
Have you hear of a breach where no single security risk looked that impressive on its own?
That’s not a coincidence. Real attacks don’t win because of one perfect exploit. They happen when multiple, often unremarkable issues are chained together. Because small, forgettable issues get connected by someone who understands the system better than the people defending it.

In this talk, we’re going to look at trending vulnerabilities rooted in real-world business logic, and more importantly, how attackers actually connect them and turn them into complete attack chains.
We’ll walk through modern attack chains involving supply chain compromises, third party dependencies, dependency confusion, broken access controls, command injection, and multi-step logic flaws that only become exploitable when you stop thinking like a defender and start thinking like an attacker. Because defenders don’t lose when they miss a vulnerability, they lose when they break the chain in the wrong place, or don’t see it forming at all.

We’ll also look at how generative AI has changed the game. How attackers are using context aware GPT agents to move faster, reduce noise, and turn what used to be DAST false positives into working exploits. How custom, AI assisted 0-days are no longer a future problem..they’re already here."

- name: The Path That Leads to Your First CVE  (past)
  descr: "In cybersecurity, we love frameworks, playbooks, and repeatable processes. Finding your first 'Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures' (CVEs) is often presented as a step-by-step recipe; For instance, use these tools, follow this methodology, target these technologies, etc. This talk argues that this approach is misleading. There is no single correct path to vulnerability research, and forcing yourself to follow someone else's formula often leads to frustration instead of real understanding, especially when it ignores what genuinely motivates you.

In this talk, TheMalwareGuardian will walk us through different paths that security professionals have taken to responsibly report a vulnerability for the first time and obtain a CVE. Some of these paths are more direct and beginner-friendly, while others are indirect or completely unexpected. What they all have in common is not a specific technique or toolset, but sustained curiosity and a genuine interest in understanding how something works, and why sometime fails.

Drawing from his own experiences as concrete examples, our presenter will explain how vulnerabilities are discovered, reported to vendors, and eventually cataloged and assigned CVEs ID, while also addressing the real-world challenges of managing these communications and timelines.
 
The goal of this talk is not to teach a recipe for getting a CVE, but to help attendees recognize their own path. 
When you focus on what you truly enjoy and stay there long enough, vulnerability research stops feeling forced, and meaningful results tend to appear naturally."

- name: 10 Years Later, A Security Journey Retrospective, a hacker decade of growth (past)
  descr: "Ten years ago, Mike Lisi aka MikeHacksThings had a first conference talk at BSidesRochester about transitioning into penetration testing. A decade later, the core message remains relevant, but the industry has transformed dramatically. This retrospective examines the evolution of security careers, technical methodologies, and business realities through the lens of personal experience - from newbie pentester to company founder and assuming the leadership of the Red Team Village. 
Mike will share lessons learned at the intersection of building technical skills, running a security business, and learning the importance of your professional network. Whether you're considering a career in security or reflecting on your own journey, this talk offers honest perspective on what matters, what doesn't, and how to build sustainable success in an ever-changing industry.
The Red Team Village has a significant influence on the cybersecurity community by providing a vital hub for hands-on training, knowledge sharing, and skill development in offensive security.
MikeHacksThings will share an honest look at what changes, what doesn’t, and what actually matters when you spend a decade breaking things for a living"

- name: Hacker things with Jayson E Street Hacking the mind - the magic of social engineering. (past)
  descr: "This time our group DCG518 have a real treat for you. We are not talking about zero-days, exploits, or firewalls… not yet. Instead, we are diving into something even more powerful: the art of influencing people. The most unpredictable system in any network, the human mind.
  
Our speaker Jayson E Street is a master at this craft. A renowned hacker and cybersecurity personality, he’s been on stages from major security conferences to talk shows, sharing stories that make you think and laugh, and sometimes leave you impressed and slightly unnerved at once. He is a versatile penetration tester, a natural storyteller, and someone who can build trust faster than most of us can open a terminal.

This time Jayson will take us on a journey through the world of social engineering. You will learn not just the basics, but the subtle magic behind why it works, how it’s everywhere in our daily lives, and perhaps most intriguingly how we can use this knowledge to our advantage: in problem solving, in getting ahead at work, and navigating life more effectively.
Prepare to think differently, because by the end of this talk, you might realize that humans can be both the greatest vulnerability and the most powerful tool in cybersecurity."

- name: The Crown’s Weak Link – Unmasking Active Directory ESC Misconfigurations, Exploiting Flaws in Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) for Full Domain Compromise (past)
  descr: "Have you used Kerberos and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to “secure” your Active Directory environment? 
This talk unravels how a simple misconfiguration within ESC can lead to easy wins for an attacker and complete control over your Active Directory domain.
Privilege escalation in Active Directory (AD) allows cyber attackers to increase access within the environment and potentially compromise entire networks—undetected.

We’ll walk through why ESC flaws are so damaging and which template settings to avoid when using ADCS. You’ll see how attackers can chain vulnerabilities like PetitPotam (NTLM Relay Attack) and ADCS web enrollment for privilege escalation, achieving Domain Admin in less than 30 seconds.

By the end of this presentation, you will understand which configurations to avoid and how to detect these flaws in your own environment for prevention, mitigation and remediation purposes. We’ll also cover detection tools and how this data can be ingested into platforms like BloodHound."

- name: The Cookie Jar Compromised - Deconstructing Web Cookie Exploitation. From leaving Crumbs to Complete Surveillance. (past)
  descr: "Think cookies are just harmless crumbs left behind by websites? Think again. 
In this presentation, we will dissect the real nature of browser cookies — how they are harvested, how that data gets traded, and how is weaponized by third parties to shadow your every move across the world wide web. We will expose the under-the-hood mechanics of online web tracking, from deceptive consent banners like pop-ups to the vast data ecosystems profiting off your clicks. You will walk away with practical defenses, including how to wield tools like uMatrix and the Brave browser to disrupt tracking and take back control of your digital footprint."
